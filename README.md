# the repo strecture/ test branch.
I called this branch test because i'm testing my knowldge and my code on it.

      * backend folder: is strectured exactly in the defualt django strecture.
           * the models are three moddles one called elements which has all the data that deside how to page should look like.
           * the styles models is a css alternative where I can create and update my stles and give them names and then I can mention them inside the elements model to activate them.
           * the component model is where I add pre made component to call it in one click.
           
      *fronend folder:
          * src/apiHooks: has threes files each one of them is a function of crud operations used as a custom hooks.
               * useElements is the hook that desidte how the page shoudl look like.
               * useStyles is the hook that I can use it as an alternative to css file, but in this case I mentions the name of the stale  inside style={..styles.name} instead of giveing the lement a name then styling the name.
               * `useComponents` I use this hook to build premade component. For example, if I want to make an artical insdead of definng and h1 for the title then p for the paragraph I can just grap an artical template from it by PUT its elements data inside the useElements model,
